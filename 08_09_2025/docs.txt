WebSocket and Its Difference from HTTP
Last Updated : 08 Aug, 2025
HTTP and WebSocket are both ways for computers to talk to each other, but they work in different ways. HTTP is used for simple requests, like when you load a webpage, where the computer sends a request and the server replies, then the connection is closed. WebSocket keeps the connection open, allowing for real-time, two-way communication, making it great for things like live chats or online games where constant updates are needed. 

Unlike HTTPâ€™s request-response model, WebSockets allow real-time data exchange without repeated requests.
Once established, the connection stays open until explicitly closed by either side.
Reduces overhead of repeated HTTP headers, enabling faster message delivery.
Typically uses port 80 (ws://) or 443 (wss:// for secure WebSockets) and supported by Most modern browsers and server frameworks.
