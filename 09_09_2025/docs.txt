Introduction to WebSockets
--------------------------
WebSockets provide a persistent connection between client and server, allowing for real-time, bidirectional communication.
This is different from traditional HTTP, which follows a request-response model.

Key Benefits of WebSockets
--------------------------
Real-time updates: Instantly push data to clients.
Efficient: No need for repeated HTTP requests.
Bidirectional: Both client and server can send messages.
Low latency: Messages are sent immediately.
